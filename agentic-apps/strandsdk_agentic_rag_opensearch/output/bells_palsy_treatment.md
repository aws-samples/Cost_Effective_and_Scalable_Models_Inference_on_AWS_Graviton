# Bell's Palsy Treatment Guide
## Overview
Bell's palsy is a sudden, unilateral facial paralysis of unknown origin (idiopathic). It requires immediate evaluation to rule out other causes like stroke, infections, or tumors, as treatment depends on accurate diagnosis.

## Key Initial Treatment Consideration
The **most critical aspect of initial treatment** is **confirming Bell's palsy as a diagnosis of exclusion**. This involves:
- A thorough neurological exam to assess facial nerve function.
- Ruling out alternative causes (e.g., Lyme disease, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, acoustic neuroma).
- No immediate medication until other conditions are excluded.

## Recommended Management
1. **Steroids**: High-quality evidence supports **oral corticosteroids** (e.g., prednisone) to reduce inflammation.
2. **Antivirals**: Controversial; some guidelines recommend **antiviral therapy** (e.g., valacyclovir) in combination with steroids for severe cases.
3. **Monitoring**: Close follow-up to ensure improvement and detect complications like corneal damage (use eye protection/saline drops).

## Prognosis
- Most patients recover fully within 3â€“6 months.
- Severe cases may require physical therapy or surgical intervention if recovery is incomplete.
