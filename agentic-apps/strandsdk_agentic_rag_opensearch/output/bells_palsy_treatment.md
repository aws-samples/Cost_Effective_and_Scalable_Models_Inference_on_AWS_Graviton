# Bell's Palsy Treatment Overview

**Bell's palsy** is a sudden, unilateral facial paralysis of unknown cause (idiopathic). The **critical first step in treatment** is confirming a **diagnosis of exclusion**, meaning other causes of facial weakness must be ruled out through systematic evaluation.

## Key Management Steps:
1. **Diagnosis of Exclusion**
   - Conduct thorough neurological exams and imaging (MRI/CT) to exclude conditions like stroke, infections, tumors, or Lyme disease.
   - No specific treatment can be initiated until other pathologies are excluded.
2. **Post-Diagnosis Care**
   - **Corticosteroids** (e.g., prednisone) are first-line therapy to reduce inflammation.
   - Antivirals may be considered in certain cases (evidence mixed).
   - Eye protection (e.g., lubricating drops, eye patches) for patients unable to close their eyelids.
3. **Prognosis**
   - Most patients recover fully within 6â€“12 months.

## Limitations of Current Data
- The provided sources focus on diagnostic rigor but lack specifics on treatment protocols (e.g., dosages, therapy duration).
- Always confirm with updated clinical guidelines for detailed management steps.
