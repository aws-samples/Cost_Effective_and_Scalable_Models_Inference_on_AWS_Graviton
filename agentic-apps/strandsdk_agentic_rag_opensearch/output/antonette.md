## The Story
Antonette, a creative and detail-oriented graphic designer, woke up one morning with sudden facial numbness and drooping on her right side. She noticed she couldn’t blink her right eye fully and struggled to smile. Panicked, she rushed to the clinic, where her doctor confirmed Bell’s palsy—a diagnosis of exclusion requiring careful evaluation to rule out other causes.

The physician emphasized the **most critical aspect of initial treatment**: **eye protection**. Antonette learned that her inability to close her right eyelid left her vulnerable to corneal drying and injury. To safeguard her vision, she was prescribed:
- Artificial tears every 2 hours during the day
- An eye patch at night
- Lubricating ointment before sleep

Though frustrated by the limitations, Antonette religiously followed the regimen. Over weeks, her facial muscles slowly regained strength. Her diligence paid off—no corneal damage occurred, and by 6 months, her smile was nearly back to normal.

Antonette’s story underscores how **early, proactive eye care** can prevent irreversible harm in Bell’s palsy. Today, she advocates for awareness, sharing how prioritizing small daily steps saved her vision and quality of life.
