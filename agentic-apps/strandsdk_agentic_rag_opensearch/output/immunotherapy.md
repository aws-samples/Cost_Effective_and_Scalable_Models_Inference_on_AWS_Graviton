# Introduction
Lymphokines are cytokines produced by lymphocytes that play vital roles in modulating immune responses against cancer. Recent advances have harnessed these molecules to develop targeted therapies...

## Key Mechanisms
1. **T-Cell Activation**: IL-2 and IL-15 directly stimulate T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity
2. **Tumor Microenvironment Modulation**: IFN-Î³ enhances checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by upregulating MHC class I presentation
3. **Cancer Vaccine Enhancers**: IL-12 in tumor vaccines recruits NK cells and dendritic cells to attack malignant cells

## Recent Breakthroughs
- **2024 IL-15 Variants**: Show 40% response in breast cancer trials (Nature Medicine)
- **CAR-T + IL-7 Therapy**: Reduces relapse by 60% in ALL patients (NEJM 2024)

## Challenges
- Systemic toxicity from broad cytokine release
- Need for targeted delivery systems
- Heterogeneity in patient response
