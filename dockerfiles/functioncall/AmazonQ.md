# Weather Function Call Service Fixes

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the error: `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` that occurred when processing chat requests.

## Root Cause
The error was occurring because:
1. The JSON payload in the curl request was missing a closing curly brace `}`, causing invalid JSON
2. The server code wasn't properly handling errors when parsing function arguments
3. There was insufficient error handling around function responses

## Changes Made
1. Added robust error handling for function call processing
2. Added safe parsing of function arguments with better error messages
3. Implemented a fallback response when function call processing fails
4. Added better handling for None responses from weather functions
5. Improved logging for debugging function call issues

## How to Test
Use the following corrected curl command:

```bash
curl -i -X POST 'http://k8s-kuberays-weatherf-32a06e12b4-9249af50fedb7b66.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/chat' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234' \
-d '{
    "model": "Qwen/QwQ-32B-AWQ",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful weather assistant. Use the provided functions to get weather information."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "what is the current weather in London"
      }
    ]
}'
```

Note the closing curly brace at the end of the JSON payload.
