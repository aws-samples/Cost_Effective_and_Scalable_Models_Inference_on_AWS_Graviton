## Her Journey to Recovery

Antonette awoke one morning to find the right side of her face drooping. She couldn’t smile evenly, her right eye refused to close, and even raising her eyebrows felt impossible. Panicked, she rushed to her doctor, who diagnosed Bell’s palsy—a sudden weakness of facial muscles due to nerve inflammation.

The doctor emphasized the **most critical step**: protecting her eye. Without full closure, her cornea risked drying out, leading to severe damage. She was prescribed **lubricating eye drops** to use hourly and a **moisture-retaining eye mask** for sleep. A clear **eye shield** was also provided to guard against dust and injury.

While **prednisone** (a corticosteroid) was started to reduce nerve swelling, Antonette’s diligence with eye care became her daily priority. Over weeks, her facial muscles slowly regained strength. Her persistence paid off—by three months, her smile was nearly back to normal, and her eyes remained healthy thanks to her proactive care.

Antonette’s story highlights how **simple yet vital measures** like eye protection can prevent complications, ensuring a smoother recovery from Bell’s palsy.
